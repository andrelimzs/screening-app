		<h2>3.1.3. FRAIL SCALE</h2>
		<h3>For each for the following question, assign a score of 1 or 0 depending on the participant's answer.</h3>
		1. Fatigue: How much of the time during the past 4 weeks did you feel tired?<br />1 = All of the time<br />2 = Most of the time<br />3 = Some of the time<br />4 = A little of the time<br />5 = None of the time<br /><br />Responses of “1” or “2” are scored as 1 and all others as 0.<br />
		<RadioField name="geriFrailScaleQ1" label="Geri - Frail Scale Q1"/>
		2. Resistance: By yourself and not using aids, do you have any difficulty walking up 10 steps without resting?<br />1 = Yes<br />0 = No <br />
		<RadioField name="geriFrailScaleQ2" label="Geri - Frail Scale Q2"/>
		3. Ambulation: By yourself and not using aids, do you have any difficulty walking several hundred yards? (approx. > 300m)<br />1 = Yes<br />0 = No <br /><br />
		<RadioField name="geriFrailScaleQ3" label="Geri - Frail Scale Q3"/>
		4. Illnesses: For 11 illnesses, participants are asked, “Did a doctor ever tell you that you have [illness]?” <br />The illnesses include hypertension, diabetes, cancer (other than a minor skin cancer), chronic lung disease, heart attack, congestive heart failure, angina, asthma, arthritis, stroke, and kidney disease.<br /><br />The total illnesses (0–11) are recorded as <br />0–4 = 0 and 5–11 = 1.<br />
		<SelectField name="geriFrailScaleQ4" checkboxes="true" label="Geri - Frail Scale Q4" />
		5. Loss of weight: How much do you weigh with your clothes on but without shoes? [current weight] <br />One year ago, in October 2018, how much did you weigh without your shoes and with your clothes on? [weight 1 year ago]. <br /><br />Percent weight change is computed as: <br />[[weight 1 year ago - current weight]/weight 1 year ago]] * 100.<br />What is the percentage (%) weight change?<br /><br />Percent change > 5 (representing a 5% loss of weight) is scored as 1 and < 5 as 0.<br /><br />If participant cannot remember his/her weight, ask if there was any significant loss in weight the past year.<br />
		<TextField name="geriFrailScaleQ5" label="Geri - Frail Scale Q5"/>
		<h3><br />Frail scale scores range from 0-5 (i.e. 1 point for each component; 0 = best to 5 = worst) and represent frail (3-5), pre-frail (1-2), and robust (0) health status.<br />For score of 1 and above, REFER TO PHYSIOTHERAPIST CONSULT. <br /></h3>
		Total score (out of 5): <TODO-MANUALLY name="geriFrailScaleQ6" label="Geri - Frail Scale Q6" />
